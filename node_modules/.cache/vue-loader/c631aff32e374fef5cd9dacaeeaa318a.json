This exam might turn up a condition that needs medical attention, such as high blood pressure or a heart arrhythmia like atrial fibrillation. In addition, you’ll be screened for infectious diseases you may be unaware of.<p>\n\n<p>“If we detect an issue with your vital signs or otherwise, we would direct you to go to a physician at that point to be checked,” Dr. DeSimone says.<p>\n\n<p>The health screening will also reveal if you have a rare blood type. This information can be useful if you ever face surgery or another medical situation in which a transfusion may be required. Plus, you’ll have the satisfaction of knowing your donation is particularly needed.</p>\n<h2>A Healthier Heart and Vascular System</h2>\n<p>Regular blood donation is linked to lower blood pressure and a lower risk for heart attacks. “It definitely helps to reduce cardiovascular risk factors,” says Dr. DeSimone.</p>\n<p>What’s the connection? “If your hemoglobin is too high, blood donation helps to lower the viscosity of the blood, which has been associated with the formation of blood clots, heart attacks, and stroke,” Dr. DeSimone says. “Interestingly, these benefits are more significant in men compared to women. We think maybe it’s because women have menstrual cycles, so they do it naturally without donating blood.”</p>\n<p>People with a condition called hereditary hemochromatosis must have blood removed regularly to prevent the buildup of iron. Fortunately, this blood can benefit others.</p>\n<p>“These are essentially healthy patients who are otherwise normal, but they have a gene mutation where they make too much blood, and they make too much normal blood,” Dr. Vossoughi says. “So we can use that blood.”</p>\n<p>The New York Blood Center Hereditary Hemochromatosis Program allows people with hemochromatosis to donate blood rather than have it removed and thrown away. “Instead of having to go to a clinic or go to one of our phlebotomy centers every few months to reduce their blood volume, they can go to any local blood drive,” Dr. Vossoughi says. “That blood will then be used for somebody who needs it.”</p>\n<h3>A Happier, Longer Life</h3>\n<p>One blood donation can save up to three lives, according to Dr. DeSimone. People usually donate because it feels good to help others, and altruism and volunteering have been linked to positive health outcomes, including a lower risk for depression and greater longevity.</p>\n<p>“Giving blood is a way to engage in the immediate community and help people around you,” Dr. Vossoughi adds. “People who do these types of things and engage in their community in this way tend to have better health and longer lives.”</p>\n<h3>Added Bonus: A Calorie-free Snack</h3>\n<p>“For one blood donation, it takes your body about 500 calories to replace it,” Dr. Vossoughi says. Thus, the juice and cookies you’re offered after giving blood are a “zero-calorie snack,” she says. If you prefer, go for a fancy dessert instead!</p> -->\n\n    </div>\n",null]}
